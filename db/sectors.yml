  name: Forestry
  description: The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest, stretching over an area of over five million square kilometers. Most of the forest is contained within Brazil, where the Amazon originally occupied over four million square kilometers of the country’s territory—an area equivalent to almost half of continental Europe. Roughly half the slowdown in deforestation in the late-2000s was a result of deliberate government policy, while better land productivity has led to increased agricultural output. Having greatly reduced large-scale deforestation, Brazil’s challenge now is to address small-scale deforestation, which may require different policy approaches.

  description: Transport offers large immediate and long-term opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the U.S. The pattern for transport-related growth in greenhouse gas emissions in the two regions was remarkably similar—a sustained rise with increasing passenger and freight traffic and strong growth in air travel only partially offset by gradual efficiency improvements. Emissions peaked in 2007 in both economies before high fuel prices and then recession curbed and reversed.
