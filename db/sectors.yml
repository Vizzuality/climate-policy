  description: In China and India rapid growth in electricity demand mirrored rapid economic growth, while the most readily available source of indigenous fuel was coal. In the EU and U.S., slower demand growth and a gradual move away from coal to nuclear, gas, and renewable sources kept emissions from growing and led to recent declines. In all four countries, despite strong growth in renewable energy, its impact on carbon intensity was only beginning to be felt.

industry:

  description: "Emissions fell in the more developed countries, as policies, rising energy prices, and pressure to maintain economic competitiveness combined with the gradual decline and movement offshore of more carbon intensive industries. In the developing world, meanwhile, rapid growth and industrialization overwhelmed the significant improvement in energy efficiency that was possible due to the lower starting efficiency of industries there."

forestry:

  description: The Amazon is the world’s largest rainforest and mostly contained within Brazil, making Brazilian forestry policy one of the most important climate-related policies in the world. Roughly half the slowdown in deforestation in the late-2000s was a result of deliberate government policy. Having greatly reduced large-scale deforestation, Brazil’s challenge now is to address small-scale deforestation, which may require different policy approaches.

transport:

  description: Transport offers immediate and long-term opportunities to reduce emissions in Europe and the U.S. Emissions peaked in 2007 in both economies before high fuel prices and then recession curbed and reversed emissions growth. This general pattern overshadowed the European automobile fleet’s more fuel efficient starting point, thanks in part to significantly higher fuel taxes in Europe than in the U.S.
