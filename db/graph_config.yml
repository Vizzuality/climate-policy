  description: Brazil made increasing the productivity of agricultural land a priority as a means to reduce expansion into new land and deforestation. Subsidies to producers, in part to modernize their operations, steadily increased over time. In the 1990s, credit subsidies were offset by price controls set below market prices; as these price controls rose above market prices, they became additional effective subsidies.
