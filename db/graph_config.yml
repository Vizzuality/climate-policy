  table: china_power_1_emissions_generation_copy_diego
  description: Electricity generation and the associated CO2 emissions increased significantly in the past three decades, with generation growth accelerating significantly in the tenth Five Year Plan (2001-2005). Since 2006, the growth in power demand has slowed slightly with CO2 emissions following suit.
