tagline: Protecting forests through policy
description: In any discussion of Brazilian climate policy, the first topic is deforestation. Brazil has seen marked success in climate-related policies and may be a good model for other emerging economies. Roughly half the slowdown in deforestation in the late-2000s was a result of deliberate government policy, while better land productivity has led to increased agricultural output.

    <p class="graph-description">Common drivers of deforestation, such as commodity prices, and land protection appear to have changed deforestation patterns, with large scale deforestation declining much more rapidly than small scale (e.g. tracts of less than 25 hectares).</p>
