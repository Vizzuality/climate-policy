tagline: Protecting forests through policy
description: In any discussion of Brazilian climate policy, the first topic is deforestation. Brazil has seen marked success in climate-related policies and may be a good model for other emerging economies. Roughly half the slowdown in deforestation in the late-2000s was a result of deliberate government policy, while better land productivity has led to increased agricultural output.

        <p class="graph-description long">Brazil made increasing the productivity of agricultural land a priority as a means to reduce expansion into new land and deforestation. Subsidies to producers, in part to modernize their operations, steadily increased over time. In the 1990s, credit subsidies were offset by price controls set below market prices; as these price controls rose above market prices, they became additional effective subsidies.</p>
